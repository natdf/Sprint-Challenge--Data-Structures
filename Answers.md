1. The order of insertions and removals for the following data structures are as follows:

- Stack:

A stack is similar to a stack of plates. 
The last item placed in the stack is the first item to be removed from the stack. 

- Queue:

A queue is similar to a line of people. The first item inserted into a queue is the first item to be removed from the queue. 

2. The retrieval time complexity for the following data structures is as follows:

- Linked List: O(n)
- Hash Table: O(1)
- Binary Search Trees: O(log n)

3. Using hash tables over an array in JavaScript can allow for greater speed when accessing and returning large amounts of data.
